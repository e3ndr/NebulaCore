# Nebula default configuration, see https://wiki.ess3.net/mc/ for color codes.

# Global placeholders (can be used anywhere):
#               player_username, player_displayname, player_name, player_chatcolor, player_chattag, player_world, player_ping, player_balance 
#               online, online_s, online_isAre +  all PlaceHolderAPI placeholders (If present)
# 
# player_name follows this format:
# nickname if set,
# displayname if set,
# then username if all else fails.
# 
# All global placeholders are available under PlaceholderAPI when prefixed with "nebula_" eg. %nebula_player_ping%
# 
# 
# Every line is followed by a list of possible placeholders (excluding global) and more information.
# 
#
